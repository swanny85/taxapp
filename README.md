# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

To get started rin `bin/setup` to install the gems and other javascript dependencies.  In addition to this you may want to run `gem install overmind` or `gem install foreman` if you don't already have one of them installed already.

`bin/dev` will start the server and then you'll be able to get started at `localhost:3000`

Here's a quick overview video: https://www.loom.com/share/55143e7509b14600beb38c4bf2925a01
